See integration_test/src/main.cc for example instruction string being used.

The available instructions are:

----- NOP
No operation

----- LOAD <register_index> <memory_offset>
Load an int (4 byte) value from `memory_offset` ints into memory
into register with index `register_index`.
Note that the `memory_offset` will be multiplied by 4 to get the actual byte offset.

----- STORECONST <memory_offset> <const_int_val>
Store a constant int value into memory.
The byte offset into memory will be calculated the same was as LOAD command
